## Record Your Lecture ##

Once you hit the record button, the movement of the controllers and headset will be tracked in real time. Your voice will also be recorded along side your movements. Any props you interact with will also be recorded as well.

## Play It Back ##

Once you are done, you can stop the recording and playback your lecture. You will see an avatar appear and procede to perform the same actions that you recorded. You will also be able to hear a playback of your voice which will be synced with your actions.

The playback will also capture the movement of any props that you interacted with while recording.
